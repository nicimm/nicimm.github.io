In the second week of class, we will circulate a survey to identify your preferred dates for your class presentation.

    <SPAN style="font-weight: bold;">Class Project:</SPAN>
    You must conduct a class project.    
    The project can be original research or (for undergrads only) a literature review on a topic related to the lectures.
    Original research projects do not need to be publishable papers by the end of the semester, but should have the potential to become publishable papers.  Thus, they should include a clear question, a proposed line-of-attack, and a few preliminary results or examples.
    <br><br>
    There are four steps to the project, with deadlines outlined below:
    <BR><BR>

    <SPAN style="font-weight: bold;">     March 1: Register your project team.</SPAN> 
    <BR><BR>
    <SPAN style="font-weight: bold;">    March 15: Write a project proposal.</SPAN> 
    <br><br>
    <SPAN style="font-weight: bold;">    April 5: Write a draft paper.</SPAN>
    <BR><BR>
    <SPAN style="font-weight: bold;">    April 12: Submit final paper and presentation slides.</SPAN>
    <BR><BR>

The final three lectures will be devoted to class presentations. 
<BR><BR> 

    <SPAN style="font-weight: bold;">    April 20-27: Present final paper to class.</SPAN>
