<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
Markets are the basic mechanism by which resources are
allocated to agents. In recent years, computer scientists and economists have re-engineered
markets with a particular eye towards efficiency (i.e., that the market optimizes the designer's objective) and stability (i.e., that the market operates in the presence of strategic agents). Examples include diverse settings with their own
peculiarities, such as organ donation, school choice
programs, course allocation, medical labor markets, and the matching of cadets to army positions.
</p><p>
This advanced Ph.D.-level course gives students a background in combinatorial optimization, matching theory, and the theory of
market design, as well as its numerous successful applications and
corresponding engineering concerns, and will include several guest lectures by industry experts.
