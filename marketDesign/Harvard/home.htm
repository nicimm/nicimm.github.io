<SPAN style="font-weight: bold;">Description</SPAN>: 
Markets are systems that allocate scarce resources to individuals, coordinate aggregate behavior and determine societal outcomes.  Networks and crowds define the unique environments in which these systems run.  The success or failure of a market depends both on the incentives of individual participants and on the structure of their relationships.

<BR><BR>

In this course, we will discuss the underlying theory and analysis of markets for social and networked environments.  Topics include the foundations of markets and auctions, as well as related current research directions.  The theory will be accompanied by case studies in relevant applications including kidney exchange, school choice programs, and online advertising.

<SPAN style="font-weight: bold;">Prerequisites</SPAN>:
There are no formal pre-requisites for this course, but mathematical maturity is recommended.  The course is intended for graduate students, but advanced undergraduates are encouraged to attend as well.  

<BR><BR>
<SPAN style="font-weight: bold;">Learning Objectives</SPAN>: 
Students will develop familiarity with fundamental concepts from applied mathematics, microeconomics, and algorithms through the lens of market design.  Students will also develop research and presentation skills through course participation and a course project.

<BR><BR>
<SPAN style="font-weight: bold;">Assessment</SPAN>:  
Assignments include 30 pages of weekly readings, 30 minutes of weekly videos, three problem sets highlighting both theoretical and applied problems, one presentation of a current research paper, and one course project.
