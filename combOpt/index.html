<H2>Description</H2>
</A>

This graduate-level course covers advanced topics in combinatorial
optimization including non-bipartite matchings, polytopes, submodular
function minimization, and matroids.  The emphasis is on the
derivation of purely combinatorial results and involves a deep
understanding of the underlying combinatorial structures.  Lectures
will be highly interactive, and students are expected to help others
master the material with in-class explanations of difficult concepts
in a group-learning environment.

<b>Note</b>: The course is based on the course <a
href="http://math.mit.edu/~goemans/18438/18438.html">Advanced
Combinatorial Optimization</a> by Michel Goemans.  Students may find
it useful to supplement their reading with his lecture notes.  I am
also posting the notes that I teach from.  These are in no way
guaranteed to be correct or even comprehensible, but nonetheless
students may find them useful as a supplement to their own notes.

<H2>Exercises</H2>

Students are expected to complete 10 problems from among these <a
href="exercises.pdf">exercises</a> (to be updated as the quarter
proceeds).  In the spirit of group learning, students are encouraged
to propose problems to be included in the list of exercises.  

<H2>Reading Projects</H2> 

Students are expected to complete a reading project which can be from
among those posted below (to be updated as the quarter proceeds)
Reading projects should be done in groups of at most two students
and will culminate in a 45 minute presentation per student as well as a written
summary of 3-5 pages.

You may also simply lecture on a (cohesive) topic covered in one of
the related courses that was not covered in our course, or you may
propose your own topic.  Make sure the topic is substantial enough to
fill a 1.5 hr lecture (or 45 minutes if you are doing the project alone), but not overly ambitious.  Assume NOTHING from
your audience beyond what was taught in this course.
