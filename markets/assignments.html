    <BR><BR>
    <SPAN style="font-weight: bold;">Class Project:</SPAN>
    You must conduct a class project.    
    The project can be original research or (for undergrads only) a literature review on a topic related to the lectures.
    Original research projects do not need to be publishable papers by the end of the semester, but should have the potential to become publishable papers.  Thus, they should include a clear question, a proposed line-of-attack, and a few preliminary results or examples.
    <br><br>
    There are four steps to the project, with deadlines outlined below:
    <BR><BR>

    <SPAN style="font-weight: bold;">     October 13: Register your project team.</SPAN> 
    <br>
    Send Nicole, Brendan, and Jerry an email, cc-ing all project partners, with the subject CS234r Class Project.
    <BR>


    <BR><BR>

    <SPAN style="font-weight: bold;">    October 27: Write a project proposal.</SPAN> 
    <BR>
    Reply-all to your registration email, attaching a 1 page pdf document describing your intended project.  We will reply with comments and suggestions.
    You may submit the proposal at any time, and may resubmit based on our comments, up until the deadline.
    
    <br><br>
    <SPAN style="font-weight: bold;">    November 10: Write a draft paper.</SPAN>
    <BR>
    Reply-all to your registration email, attaching a 5-8 page pdf document describing your project outcomes.  We will set up meetings with each project group
    to discuss your results and make suggestions.

    <BR><BR>

    <SPAN style="font-weight: bold;">    December 1: Submit final paper and give presentation.</SPAN>
    <BR>
    Reply-all to your registration email, attaching your final 5-8 page pdf document describing your project outcomes.  Present your results to the class in a slide presentation (we will let you know how much time you have for your presentaiton based on the number of submissions and the sizes of the groups).
